# Operating System?

<u>Software layer between **users applications and computer hardware**</u>
ㄴ Interfacing with computer hardware and user applications software
ㄴ Very large (systemm) program or suite of programs executed by the processor

# Interface?
<u>We can use functions even without knowing the  underlying complexity of device (or hardware)</u>
ㄴ Provides convenient functionality to higher levels
ㄴ Permits an efficient implementation at lower levels

# Two Perspectives in Operating System

## - 1. Resource management (or coordinator)

⊙ (Efficiency) An OS allows the complex computer system resources  (hardware, which is limited) to be used (managed) in an efficient manner  for maximizing the performance
⊙ (Fairness) Fairly allocate hardware resources
-> guarantee user experience

## - 2. Make the computer system convenient to use

⊙ (Convenience) Allow user (or application programs) to be executed easily  (without knowing the underlying complex hardware/software details)
⊙ Make solving user problems (or requests) easily by using a computer system

***

## How many users can be executed at the same time?

⊙ **A single user system** is a system in which only one user can access the  computer system at a time.
▫	Simple but limited performance
▫	MS-DOS, Windows, Mac OS, …

⊙ **A multi user system** is a system that allows more than one user to  access a computer system at a time.
▫	Complex
▫	Need to schedule different tasks
▫	Need to manage the protection or authority of each users
▫	Can improve an overall performance
▫	Unix, Mainframe, Windows NT, Linux …

⊙ A single tasking system can only run one program or application at a
time.
▫	MS-DOS, Windows cmd
⊙ A multi tasking system can run (or handle) multiple applications and  programs at once.
▫	Most modern OS such as Linux, Unix, Windows, …

⊙ Monolithic Kernel
-Single large process running entirely in a single address space.
-All kernel services exist and execute in the kernel address space.
-Each component can efficiently communicate: Faster
-Difficult to add/delete disk drivers & Difficult to maintain (why? Big)
-UNIX, Linux

⊙ Micro Kernel
-The kernel is broken down into separate processes, known as servers.
-All servers are kept separate and run in different address spaces.
-Servers invoke "services" from each other by sending messages via IPC  (Inter Process Communication)
-Mac OS X, Windows NT, MINIX

⊙ Hybrid Kernel

# History of Operating System

## (Single) Batch processing ~1960s : As computers became faster

⊙ <u> Grab all types of programs and data in the batch form then proceed to  process together</u>
▫	Collects similar jobs, executes them automatically **without manual intervention**
▫	Special programming language, JCL (Job Control Language) in monitor
▫	Decrease the setup and takedown time -> **improve CPU utilization**

⊙ Monitor -> Simple scheduler
⊙ Single batch possesses all resources of system -> Difficult to predict run  time for a job (e.g., if any job fails)
⊙ Beneficial to a large number of jobs
▫	Mainframe (Payroll or Bank systems …)

배치 처리 시스템에서 작업(Job) 간에 I/O 작업이 발생하면, CPU는 I/O 작업이 완료될 때까지 대기해서 비효율적
-> I/O 작업이 실행될 때, 다른 작업을 동시에 처리하는 방식이 제안. 
-> 이는 Overlapping 을 통해 I/O와 CPU 작업이 동시에 진행되도록 하는 방식
-> CPU utilization 향상

***

# Multiprogramming batch processing	1960s ~ 1970s

⊙ Multiple users shared the system
▫	Degree of multiprogramming ≥ 1
▫ Multiple batch programs running at the same time on a single processor  machine to keep the system as busy as possible 
-> processor can switch  between jobs

⊙ Job spooled on disk or drum
▫	Simultaneous Peripheral Operations Online (SPOOL)
▫	Can hide slow (costly) I/O machines (ex. printer spool)
▫	Overlap of computation with asynchronous I/O
⊙ Buffering and interrupt handling added to OS
⊙ Memory protection & relocation
⊙ Concurrent programming become necessary
⊙ Job schedulers select jobs to run according to a variety of criteria, including priority, memory size, etc.
