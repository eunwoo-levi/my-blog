Software layer between **users applications and computer hardware**
ㄴ Interfacing with computer hardware and user applications software
ㄴ Very large (systemm) program or suite of programs executed by the processor

# Interface?
We can use functions even without knowing the  underlying complexity of device (or hardware)
ㄴ Provides convenient functionality to higher levels
ㄴ Permits an efficient implementation at lower levels

# Two Perspectives in Operating System

## - 1. Resource management (or coordinator)

⊙ (Efficiency) An OS allows the complex computer system resources  (hardware, which is limited) to be used (managed) in an efficient manner  for maximizing the performance
⊙ (Fairness) Fairly allocate hardware resources
-> guarantee user experience

## - 2. Make the computer system convenient to use

⊙ (Convenience) Allow user (or application programs) to be executed easily  (without knowing the underlying complex hardware/software details)
⊙ Make solving user problems (or requests) easily by using a computer system

***

## How many users can be executed at the same time?

⊙ **A single user system** is a system in which only one user can access the  computer system at a time.
▫	Simple but limited performance
▫	MS-DOS, Windows, Mac OS, …

⊙ **A multi user system** is a system that allows more than one user to  access a computer system at a time.
▫	Complex
▫	Need to schedule different tasks
▫	Need to manage the protection or authority of each users
▫	Can improve an overall performance
▫	Unix, Mainframe, Windows NT, Linux …
