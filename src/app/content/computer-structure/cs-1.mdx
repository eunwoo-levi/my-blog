Performance metrics:
How do we conclude that System A	is  better (faster) than System B ?

# How to measure the performance of computer system
- Latency vs. Throughput
- CPU time / MIPS / Benchmark
- How to summarize the performance?

# Importance Of Performance Measurement
When designing the architecture of computer systems, we need to know which system (or design methodology) is better

***

## Throughput = (1/Latency) ?    -> No

If it takes T sec to do N tasks, throughput = N/T;  latency = T/N ?
If it takes t sec to do 1 task, latency = t;  throughput = 1/t ?

Latency , Throughput  -> 역수 관계! 하지만 그렇지 않은 경우도 있다. (not always)

**Pipelining(파이프라이닝)** 은 여러 단계로 나누어진 작업을 동시에 실행할 수 있도록 만드는 구조이다. 
예를 들어, 하나의 명령어가 끝날 때까지 기다리지 않고, 다음 명령어를 동시에 실행하는 방식이다.
이 경우 Latency는 여전히 명령어 하나를 처리하는 데 걸리는 시간이므로 변하지 않는다. 그러나 파이프라인 덕분에 여러 명령어를 동시에 처리할 수 있기 때문에 Throughput은 크게 증가한다. (Overlapping을 해서 능률을 높임)

즉, Latency는 거의 변동이 없거나 일부 증가하더라도 Throughput이 증가할 수 있어, 역수 관계가 성립하지 않는다.

# Time – The First Type Of Performance

- 1. Wall-clock (잘 안씀), response time (latency), or elapsed time
ㄴ Actual time from start to completion: the time that user experience in real world
ㄴ Includes everything so unpredictable    
like ...
▫ CPU time for other programs as well as for itself
▫ Memory and disk access time
▫ Communication channel delay
▫ Operating system overhead …

- 2. <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">CPU (execution) time</span>
ㄴ CPU time spent for a given program (process)
ㄴ User CPU time (The CPU time spent in a program itself) + System CPU  time (The CPU time spent in the operating system performing a task on  behalf of the program)

즉, CPU 성능을 측정할때는 주로 **CPU time**을 사용한다.

# Measuring CPU Time: Clock

- All (or most) operations in computers are governed by a **clock** that runs at a constant rate.
ㄴ Clock signals are generated by a quartz crystal that is physical layout.
ㄴ Clock cycles, ticks, clock ticks, cycles …

- Operations in computer must be synchronized with internal clock.

- Length of clock period = clock cycle time

- Clock rate = 1 / clock cycle time


***
- (TIP)
- 1. 1 피코초(ps)와 1 나노초(ns)의 관계:
1 ns = 10^3 ps = 1000 ps

- 2. K (kilo), M (mega), G (giga), T (tera), P (peta) 
... 각 각 10^3 씩 곱해짐 (또는 2^10 씩 곱해짐)

# Measuring CPU Time: Executing 1 Instruction

- Most instructions on most processors require multiple clock  cycles to complete.
ㄴ Some instructions may take only a few cycles, while others require dozens.

- How to calculate the time to execute 1 instruction?


<br/>

CPU execution time per 1 Instruction

= (# of clock cycles for instruction) X (Clock cycle time)

= (# of clock cycles for instruction) / Clock Rate

즉,

- **IC (Instruction count)**
ㄴ Number of instructions executed for a program
- **CPI (Clock Cycles Per Instruction)**
ㄴ Average clock cycles per instructions
ㄴ CPU clock cycles (# of clock cycles) = IC X CPI

Clock rate = 1 / clock cycle time   - 역수 관계!
